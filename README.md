# Weather App

## Overview
The Weather App is a simple and user-friendly front-end web application that provides real-time weather information for any location. It allows users to check the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other weather details by entering the city name. The app fetches data from a weather API and displays it in an intuitive interface.

## Features
- **Real-time Weather Data**: Fetches and displays current weather conditions.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can enter any city name to get weather updates.
- **Temperature Display**: Shows temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit.
- **Humidity & Wind Speed**: Provides additional weather details.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple and elegant design for easy navigation.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the web pages.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For fetching data from the weather API and updating the UI.

## How It Works
1. The user enters a city name in the search input field.
2. The app fetches weather data from an external API.
3. The weather details are displayed dynamically on the web page.
4. The UI updates with temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other details.
